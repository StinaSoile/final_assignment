We used a Barabási–Albert network with 200 nodes and adapted the NSGA-II algorithm provided in the course materials, with the following settings:
    • Population size: 30
    • Generations: 15
    • Chromosome representation: Binary vector x ∈ {0,1}^200
    • Simulation repeats: 5
    • Mutation: Bit-flip mutation with probability 0.05 per bit

Generation 1: Best front size = 5
Generation 2: Best front size = 4
Generation 3: Best front size = 4
Generation 4: Best front size = 8
Generation 5: Best front size = 8
Generation 6: Best front size = 8
Generation 7: Best front size = 8
Generation 8: Best front size = 4
Generation 9: Best front size = 5
Generation 10: Best front size = 6
Generation 11: Best front size = 6
Generation 12: Best front size = 6
Generation 13: Best front size = 6
Generation 14: Best front size = 6
Generation 15: Best front size = 5
